 *
 * Providers are a fundamental concept in Nest. Many of the basic Nest
 * classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories,
 * helpers, and so on. The main idea of a provider is that it can inject
 * dependencies; this means objects can create various relationships with
 * each other, and the function of "wiring up" instances of objects can
 * largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system.
 *
 * A provider is simply a class annotated with an @Injectable() decorator.
 *
 * To create a service using the CLI, simply execute in CLI
 * nest g service SERVICENAME
